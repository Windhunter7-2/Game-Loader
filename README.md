# Game Loader
Have tons of games on your computer, and not all are through Steam? For example, emulated games, League of Legends, Vindictus, Fortnite, etc.? Want to play with a set of particular mods at the touch of a single click? The idea of this game loader program is that users will be able to easily specify the steps to load each game for setup, and then in the main menu, you’ll be able to create folders to categorize your games, “tag” your games for keyword searching, and also have literally any game you have in the one area, where all you have to do is click on the game and you’re running it!

This game loader program will in addition also will support a “mod preset swapout” for any moddable games, meaning that you can set up a series of mods and name it as a separate “game” (This will also support the autoclicker program’s “Mod swapout autoclickers”), and then that “game” would be added to your library of games like any other game.

Project Recolor (A gigantic mod project of mine) in particular will use an extension of this program that will also enable full mod swap outs in the middle of a game for a “BrawlEx”-like feel, on top of the other utilities.

Optionally, users would also be able to store their passwords on their local computer for each game, so that when they load the game, they don’t have to type their password each time. (These would be stored locally, so even though there would still be some online connectivity threat in security, there would be some security to the local vs. online storage; in addition, if the user uses a USB or other portable drive as the storage for their passwords, they could just unplug the device any time they’re not using the password loader sub-program)

Optionally, users would also have the option to change their settings via simply right-clicking on the particular game and changing the settings, and the program will do these configurations.
